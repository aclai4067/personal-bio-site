        <h3>Career Bio</h3>
        <p>
            I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Education from Georgia State University
             in December 2008. After a year as a substitute teacher I moved to Nashville and opened 
             up my job search to look beyond the education field.  Since then I've worked in credential 
             evaluation and customer service roles.    
        </p>
        <p>
            In school, I was drawn to art, and especially three dimensional mediums, by the collaborative 
            nature of the field, the desire to build, and the satisfaction of figuring out how to turn 
            an abstract idea into a physical object that works within the limitations of the medium and 
            the laws of physics. In my career, I found my strengths in communication, problem solving, 
            and research. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I initially broached the idea of a career in software developement, I really wasn't sure 
            it would be for me. While I've always been comfortable with computers and picked up new systems 
            with relative ease, I've never thought of myself as a "computer person." I was surprised to find 
            just how much coding plays to my strenths and the type of tasks that give me satisfaction in my work. 
            It requires the creative problem solving that I found to be my strength both in school and 
            my career.  It involves working withing a team and community that fosters improvement through 
            collabortation and critique, as I loved in my Art School days. My research background has helped me 
            in finding solutions when I'm stuck in my code.  And it entails a level of continuous learning that 
            is certain to stave off the sense of stagnation that has plagued me in customer services work.
